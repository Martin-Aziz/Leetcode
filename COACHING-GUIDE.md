## 🚀 How to Use This System

### **For Teaching Mode:**
1. Read problem statement thoroughly
2. Try to solve on your own (5-10 minutes)
3. Use Level 1 hint if stuck
4. Progress through hints as needed
5. Study the optimal solution
6. Complete reflection questions
7. Practice recommended similar problems

### **For Mock Interview Mode:**
1. Set a timer (15-25 minutes depending on difficulty)
2. Treat it like a real interview
3. Think aloud while solving
4. Avoid hints if possible (they reduce your score)
5. Test your solution with edge cases
6. Submit and review evaluation
7. Analyze your weaknesses

## 📈 Next Steps

After completing these 5 problems:

1. **Review all patterns** - Compare hash map vs stack vs greedy
2. **Identify your weak areas** - Which pattern needs more practice?
3. **Move to Session 2** - Medium difficulty problems
4. **Build a study schedule** - 2-3 problems per week

## 🎓 Study Tips

### **Before Each Problem:**
- Read twice, understand fully
- Identify constraints and edge cases
- Think about brute force first

### **During Problem Solving:**
- Draw examples on paper
- Think aloud (even when alone)
- Start with plan, then code
- Test as you go

### **After Each Problem:**
- Review optimal solution even if you got it
- Understand WHY this approach works
- Practice similar problems immediately
- Come back in 1 week to retry

## 💪 Motivation

> "Understanding 5 fundamental patterns deeply is better than memorizing 50 solutions."

Each problem in this set teaches a **core pattern** you'll use repeatedly in interviews. Master these, and you'll recognize them in 80% of LeetCode problems!
