## 🎓 Pattern Mastery

### Graph Cloning
- Hash map for visited tracking
- DFS or BFS deep copy
- Cycle handling

### Topological Sort
- Kahn's algorithm (BFS + in-degrees)
- DFS with 3 colors (white/gray/black)
- Cycle detection

### Level Order BFS
- Queue-based traversal
- Level separation by snapshot size
- O(w) space for width

### Trie Design
- Node structure with children map
- is_end_of_word flag
- O(m) operations

### Grid Backtracking
- Mark visited + explore + undo
- 4-direction DFS
- Try all starting points
