2. Redo mock interviews
3. Practice recommended similar problems
4. Target 90+ on all mocks before continuing

---

### Option 2: Continue to Session 3
**Recommended if:**
- All mock scores 90+
- Pattern confidence 4+/5
- Ready for harder problems

**Session 3 Preview:**
- Hard difficulty problems
- Advanced patterns (Dynamic Programming, Backtracking, etc.)
- Complex data structures (Trie, Segment Tree)
- System design basics

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips for Session 2

### Sliding Window Success
- Remember: expand right, shrink left
- Hash set for existence, hash map for counting
- Window size formula: `right - left + 1`

### Binary Search Mastery
- Always check which half is sorted
- Be careful with `<` vs `<=`
- Test with rotated and non-rotated arrays

### Graph Traversal Excellence
- DFS for simplicity, BFS for shortest path
- Always mark visited to avoid cycles
- Consider both recursive and iterative

### Array Optimization
- Think left and right separately
- Combine passes for space optimization
- Handle zeros and negatives explicitly

### BST Navigation
- Use ordering property for O(h) solutions
- Iterative often simpler than recursive
- Test with balanced and skewed trees
