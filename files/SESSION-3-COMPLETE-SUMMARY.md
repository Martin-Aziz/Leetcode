## 🎓 Key Learnings from Session 3

### Dynamic Programming Mindset
> "Break down problems into smaller subproblems. Build solutions bottom-up."

### Backtracking Template
> "Make a choice, explore recursively, undo the choice. Repeat."

### Tree Validation
> "Don't just check children. Validate entire subtree ranges."

### Selection Algorithms
> "Sorting is O(n log n). Heap is O(n log k). Quickselect is O(n) average."

### Matrix Simulation
> "Maintain boundaries. Shrink them layer by layer."
