## 📋 Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.

### Examples:

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: s = ""
Output: 0
```

### Constraints:
- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

## 🎓 Understanding the Problem

### What are we looking for?
- A **contiguous substring** (not subsequence!) with all unique characters
- We want the **maximum length** of such a substring
- If the string is empty, return 0

### Key Observations:
1. **Substring vs Subsequence:** 
   - Substring: consecutive characters (e.g., "abc" in "abcde")
   - Subsequence: can skip characters (e.g., "ace" in "abcde")
   - We need SUBSTRING!

2. **What breaks a valid substring?**
   - When we encounter a character we've already seen in our current window

3. **What do we track?**
   - Characters in our current window
   - The start of our current window
   - The maximum length found so far

## 🔍 Pattern Recognition: The Sliding Window

This is a **classic Sliding Window problem**! Here's why:

### 🪟 What is the Sliding Window Pattern?

Think of it like looking through a window that can:
- **Expand:** Add elements on the right
- **Shrink:** Remove elements from the left
- **Slide:** Move across the data structure

### When to Use Sliding Window?

✅ **Use when you need to find:**
- Contiguous subarrays/substrings with a specific property
- Maximum/minimum values in windows
- Problems with "consecutive elements" or "substring"

✅ **Common indicators:**
- "Longest substring..."
- "Maximum sum of k consecutive elements..."
- "Minimum window that contains..."
- "Find all anagrams..."

### Visual Example:

```
String: "abcabcbb"

Step 1: [a]bcabcbb          → window = {a}, length = 1
Step 2: [ab]cabcbb          → window = {a,b}, length = 2
Step 3: [abc]abcbb          → window = {a,b,c}, length = 3
Step 4: abc[a]bcbb          → 'a' repeats! Shrink from left
        ↑   ↑
      left  right
Step 5: abc[ab]cbb          → window = {a,b}, length = 2
Step 6: abc[abc]bb          → window = {a,b,c}, length = 3
...and so on
```

## 📝 High-Level Plan

### Approach: Sliding Window with Hash Set/Map

**Core Idea:**
1. Use two pointers: `left` and `right` (our window boundaries)
2. Keep a hash set/map to track characters in current window
3. Expand `right` pointer to grow window
4. When we find a duplicate, shrink from `left` until duplicate is removed
5. Track maximum window size throughout

**Pseudocode:**
```
Initialize:
    - left = 0
    - max_length = 0
    - seen = empty hash set or map

For right from 0 to end of string:
    While character at right is in seen:
        Remove character at left from seen
        Move left forward
    
    Add character at right to seen
    Update max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)

Return max_length
```

## 💡 Progressive Hints

<details>
<summary><b>💡 Hint 1: What data structure tracks "seen" characters efficiently?</b></summary>

Think about:
- We need to check if a character exists → O(1) lookup
- We need to add/remove characters → O(1) operations
- **Answer:** Hash Set (for just checking existence) or Hash Map (if we need positions)

For this problem, a **Hash Set** works, but a **Hash Map (character → index)** can make shrinking more efficient!

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>💡 Hint 2: How do we handle duplicate characters?</b></summary>

When we encounter a duplicate:

**Option 1 (Gradual Shrink):**
- Remove characters from left one by one until the duplicate is gone
- Example: "abc[a]" → remove first 'a'

**Option 2 (Jump):**
- If we store indices, we can jump directly to the position after the duplicate
- Example: If 'a' was at index 0, jump left to index 1

Both work! Option 2 is slightly more efficient.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>💡 Hint 3: What's the formula for window size?</b></summary>

If we have:
- `left` = start of window
- `right` = end of window

Then:
- **Window size = right - left + 1**

Example:
- Indices: [0,1,2,3,4]
- String:  "a b c d e"
- Window from 1 to 3 ("bcd") → 3 - 1 + 1 = 3 characters ✓

```
Initial State:
seen = {}, left = 0, max_length = 0

Step 1: right = 0, char = 'a'
├─ 'a' not in seen
├─ seen = {'a'}
├─ window size = 0 - 0 + 1 = 1
└─ max_length = 1
    Window: [a]bcabcbb

├─ seen = {'a', 'b', 'c'}
├─ window size = 2 - 0 + 1 = 3
└─ max_length = 3
    Window: [abc]abcbb

Step 4: right = 3, char = 'a'
├─ 'a' IS in seen (duplicate!)
├─ While loop:

## ⚡ Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity: **O(n)**
- The `right` pointer visits each character once: O(n)
- The `left` pointer visits each character at most once: O(n)
- Each character is added and removed from set at most once
- **Total: O(n + n) = O(n)**

### Space Complexity: **O(min(n, m))**
- `n` = length of string
- `m` = size of character set
  - Lowercase English letters: m = 26
  - All ASCII: m = 128
  - Unicode: m = 256
- Hash set/map stores at most min(n, m) characters
- **Worst case: O(n)** when all characters are unique

## 🎨 Variations to Consider

### Variation 1: **Return the actual substring, not just length**
```python
def longestUniqueSubstring(s: str) -> str:
    seen = set()
    left = 0
    max_length = 0
    result_start = 0  # Track where max substring starts
    
    for right in range(len(s)):
        while s[right] in seen:
            seen.remove(s[left])
            left += 1
        
        seen.add(s[right])
        
        if right - left + 1 > max_length:
            max_length = right - left + 1
            result_start = left
    
    return s[result_start:result_start + max_length]
```

### Variation 2: **At most K distinct characters**
```python
def lengthOfLongestSubstringKDistinct(s: str, k: int) -> int:
    """
    Find longest substring with at most k distinct characters.
    Example: s = "eceba", k = 2 → answer is 3 ("ece")
    """
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    char_count = defaultdict(int)
    left = 0
    max_length = 0
    
    for right in range(len(s)):
        char_count[s[right]] += 1
        
        # Shrink window if more than k distinct characters
        while len(char_count) > k:
            char_count[s[left]] -= 1
            if char_count[s[left]] == 0:
                del char_count[s[left]]
            left += 1
        
        max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)
    
    return max_length
```

### Variation 3: **Exactly K distinct characters**
```python
def exactlyKDistinct(s: str, k: int) -> int:
    """
    Find longest substring with exactly k distinct characters.
    Trick: at_most_k(k) - at_most_k(k-1)
    """
    def at_most_k_distinct(k):
        # Similar to variation 2
        pass
    
    return at_most_k_distinct(k) - at_most_k_distinct(k - 1)
```

## 🤔 Reflection Questions

1. **Why does the sliding window pattern work here?**
   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
   
   Because we're looking for a contiguous substring with a specific property. Once we find a duplicate, all substrings starting before the first occurrence and including the duplicate are invalid. So we can safely "slide" our window forward without missing any valid solutions.
   
   </details>

2. **What if we used a fixed-size window?**
   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
   
   Won't work! We don't know the answer in advance, so we can't fix the window size. We need a variable-size window that expands and shrinks based on the duplicate constraint.
   
   </details>

3. **Could we use two separate loops instead of while loop inside for loop?**
   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
   
   No, because we need to shrink the window immediately when we find a duplicate. The while loop ensures we remove all necessary characters from the left before adding the current character.
   
   </details>

4. **What's the worst case scenario for this algorithm?**
   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
   
   When all characters are unique (e.g., "abcdef"), we never shrink the window. Time is still O(n), but space is O(n) because we store all characters.
   
   </details>

✅ **Communication:**
- Walk through example before coding
- Explain your thought process while writing
- Test with edge cases at the end

### Common Mistakes to Avoid:

❌ Forgetting to handle empty string  
❌ Using wrong window size formula (right - left vs right - left + 1)  
❌ Not removing from hash set when shrinking  
❌ Checking `left < right` (not needed with proper logic)  
❌ Returning `max_length - 1` (off-by-one error)
